# Spatial Exploration of ArcHaeological Objects in R Shiny

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/581203118.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/581203118)

SEAHORS is a R Shiny free open-source application, that allows easy and quick exploration of the spatial distribution of archaeological objects.
The main goal of this application is to make the two and three-dimensional spatial exploration of archaeological data as user-friendly as possible, 
in order to give opportunities to researchers not familiar with GIS and R to undertake such approaches.

SEAHORS has an easily accessible interface and uses text and Excel files (.csv and .xls respectively). The application  includes functions to merge several databases, 
for example when spatial data and analysis data are stored in separate files.

SEAHORS can generate five types of plots: 3D, 2D and density plots, as well as plots for which it is possible to cut off the site into slices and to modify the angle 
of projection to explore spatial organisation without constraint of the grid orientation. SEAHORS has visualization tools with several sorting and formatting keys 
(colours) applicable to coordinates and all possible analysis variables (i.e. levels, splits, analytical attributes).

## Installation 

- Install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and optionally Rstudio Desktop (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to have a more comfortable R environment.
- Open the script in R or Rstudio.
- To execute the R shiny script in R, you must highlight the code (“Select all” or CTRL + A) and click on “Run all” or press CTRL + R. 
- To execute the R shiny script in R studio, you can either highlight the code (“Select all” or CTRL + A) and click on “Run selected lines” or CTRL + Enter, or simply  click on the "Run App" button (at the top of the editor window). 

The application will be launched automatically and the necessary R package will be installed automatically the first time.

The first launch may therefore take some time. 

## Demonstration and tutorial
The application overview is detailled the paper (Royer et al. preprint, see Reference).

A tutorial video of SEAHORS is available [in English](https://nakala.fr/10.34847/nkl.3fdd6h8j) and [in French](https://nakala.fr/10.34847/nkl.65bf1h72).

A web application of SEAHORS v1 is deployed on the  Shinyapps.io server: https://aurelienroyer.shinyapps.io/Seahors/

## Update
### v1.5 April 2023
Add ggplot 2D tab :"Simple 2D plot" with pdf download and numeric imput to modify the projection ratio. 

Add a button "advanced plot" at ggplot 2D slide to activated plotly or ggplot figure. Add a ratio imput when the button is unchecked.  

Add "Figure options" sidebar conditional panel : to modify the labels axis, the size of the labels and the tick mark, the space between major tick mark and minor grid (without tick marks), and the theme of ggplot figure ("Simple 2D plot" and "Density Plot").

Add a button to directly load the dataset example of Cassenade. Button is on the overview panel. 

Correction DensityPlot and modification of point size and transparency. 

Correction color for simple 2D plot

Correction color for refit projection
